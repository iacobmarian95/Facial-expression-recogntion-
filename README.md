# Facial-expression-recogntion-
I puprose an architecture for facial expression recognition using a a pre-trained CNN RESNET50. The reason is simple : why I must create and train a new neural network and lose a lot of time to train it, if I can use a pre-trainned CNN on millions images and have a greate feature extractor.  Using a pre-trained network and just adapting last layer for the 7 facial expressions, the train process on FER2013 is more less.
